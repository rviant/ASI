Hi Luis,
 
Thank you very much for your interesting in helping us with this project.  Here is some information:
 
-          The name of our program is: Academic Success Initiative

-          What is ASI?

The Academic Success Initiative (ASI) was founded in the Advising Center of the School of Computing & Information Sciences (SCIS) at Florida International University (FIU).  Its mission is to assist students achieve their academic goals and holistic development during their undergraduate years.  

-          This program is composed of intentional activities that advisor-advisee revise together in a weekly basis to monitor positive outcomes.  One important component of this program is the learning support facilitated by students called Ambassadors (tutors). This group was created to supply the scarcity of tutoring support in major specific courses, to understand the challenges that students face in foundational courses, and most importantly, to assist students off classroom under the project lead supervision.
